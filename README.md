# Hand Gesture Virtual Instrument

A web-based musical instrument that lets you play notes by moving your hand in front of a webcam.

## Features

- 7-Note Scale: Play C to B (C4-B4)
- Multi-Octave Support: Move hand closer/farther to shift octaves (-2 to +2)
- Dynamic Volume: Hand position left-to-right controls volume (0.5x to 1.5x)
- Waveform Selection: Choose sine, triangle, sawtooth, or square waves
- Recording and Playback: Record your hand gestures and play them back
- Visual Effects: Finger trails and particle effects
- Secure: Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonces, HTTPS-ready
- Offline-Ready: Works with local vendor files (no CDN dependencies)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm
- Webcam or camera
- Modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Download vendor files (Tone.js, MediaPipe, etc.)
npm run vendor:fetch

# 3. Start development server
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

### First Run

1. Click the Start button
2. Allow camera access when prompted
3. Move your hand in front of the camera to play notes

Tips:
- Higher on screen = higher notes
- Closer to camera = higher octaves
- Left side = quieter, right side = louder
- All 7 notes light up as you move your hand

```

### Building and Utility

```bash
npm run vendor:build     # Bundle vendors into single file (optional)

npm run inspect:wasm     # Analyze WASM file references
```

### Testing

```bash
node tests.js            # Run unit tests
# Then open http://localhost:8080/test-runner.html in browser
```

## How to Play

### Controls

Note Selection - Move hand vertically (up/down):
- Top = B (highest note)
- Middle = F/G
- Bottom = C (lowest note)

Octave Shift - Move hand toward/away from camera (depth):
- Far away (-0.1m) = Octave -2
- Normal distance = Octave 0
- Close to camera (+0.05m) = Octave +2

Volume Control - Move hand left/right:
- Left edge = 50% volume (quiet)
- Center = 100% volume (normal)
- Right edge = 150% volume (loud)

### Recording

1. Click Record to start recording
2. Move your hand to play notes
3. Click Record again to stop
4. Click Playback to hear your recording
5. Use Select All or Deselect All to choose which notes play back

## Security

This app implements enterprise-grade security:

- Content Security Policy (CSP) with nonce-based script injection
- HTTPS enforcement (smart detection of reverse proxy)
- Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for vendor files
- Safe DOM practices (no innerHTML)
- WASM security (proper permissions and headers)

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for details.

### Browser Requirements

- WebAssembly support
- WebGL (for hand detection)
- Web Audio API
- WebRTC (camera access)

## Deployment

### Quick Deployment Steps

```bash
# 1. Install production dependencies
npm install --omit=dev

# 2. Download vendor files
npm run vendor:fetch

# 3. Build (optional, for bundled vendors)
npm run vendor:build

# 4. Start production server
NODE_ENV=production npm start
```

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed guides for:
- Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean, Vercel
- Docker deployment
- Nginx reverse proxy setup
- SSL/HTTPS configuration

## Troubleshooting

### Camera not detected

- Check browser permissions (DevTools > Application > Permissions)
- Verify camera works in other apps
- Try a different browser

### Hand not detected

- Ensure good lighting
- Try moving hand slowly
- Check [SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md](SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md) - "Troubleshooting"

### WASM loading errors

- Run `npm run vendor:fetch` to download WASM files
- Check browser DevTools Console for errors
- See [SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md](SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md) - "Troubleshooting"

### Sound not working

- Check volume slider (should be greater than 0%)
- Verify browser audio permissions
- Try different waveform
- Check DevTools Console for errors

For more issues, see [SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md](SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md#troubleshooting).

## Learning Resources

This project is a useful learning resource for:

- Web Audio API: Tone.js synthesizer usage
- Machine Learning in Browser: MediaPipe Hands integration
- Real-time Processing: Hand tracking and audio synthesis loop
- Security Best Practices: CSP, HTTPS, safe DOM practices
- Modern JavaScript: Async/await, events, DOM manipulation
- WebAssembly: WASM module loading and execution

## Performance

- FPS: Approximately 30 FPS (optimized for real-time response)
- Latency: Less than 100ms (hand detection to sound)
- Bundle Size:
  - Core app: ~50KB (minified)
  - Tone.js: ~400KB
  - MediaPipe: ~4MB (WASM)

Frame skipping enables smooth performance on slower devices.

## Tips and Tricks

1. Use headphones for better audio quality
2. Good lighting improves hand detection
3. Smooth movements reduce note flickering
4. Experiment with waveforms - each has different sound quality
5. Record multiple takes - select best one to play back
